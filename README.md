### Hey there.
I'm a computer science major at Northeastern. I mostly consider myself a beginner/intermediate developer, but in my spare time I do enjoy exploring different programming languages, tools, and Linux distros. Occasionally, you'll find me working on projects that mostly have to do with gaming in some shape or form. When I'm not, chances are that you'll find me helping my friends chaotically make food, [learning things about being a car mechanic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/645630/Car_Mechanic_Simulator_2018/), or playing a variety of fighting games. I'm currently playing:
- [Guilty Gear Strive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/)
  - I main Chipp. I also dabble in Ky and Nagoriyuki.
- [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com)
  - You'll usually see me play Roy, Fox, or Ken.
- [Dragon Ball FighterZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/678950/DRAGON_BALL_FighterZ/)
  - I haven't been playing much lately, but I've always ran Goku Black mid.
